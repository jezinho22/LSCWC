					As long ago as the 1880s, Hermann Ebbinghaus was showing how sequences
					of information can be learned by being exposed to them and then
					recalling them, and this is what our flash cards enable. Ebbinghaus
					concluded that the most effective way to learn facts was to revisit
					them at intervals, which increase after each learning. So for best
					results, use our flashcards again after half a day, a full day, three
					days, 6 days, 12 days and 24 days. Or more often, if you like.

					Students, with supportive instruction, are capable of learning to
					develop and use a combination of phonological, orthographic and
					morphological strategies from the earliest years of school (Critten et
					al 2013, Daffern 2018, Treiman & Kessler 2014).
				</p>
				<p class="body-text">
					But not every word can be spelled with this knowledge, and many of us
					struggle with words with multiple “tricky bits”.

					“I cannot write in English, because of the treacherous spelling. When
					I am reading, I only hear it and am unable to remember what the write
					word looks like” Albert Einstein
				</p>
				<p class="body-text">
					Research tells us that practising and learning words is likely to
					improve spelling competence, and if this is combined with the
					strategies above, the likely improvement is significant (Fisher et al,
					2007). Therefore our flashcards provide cues about tricky bits and
					where morphology can also help.
